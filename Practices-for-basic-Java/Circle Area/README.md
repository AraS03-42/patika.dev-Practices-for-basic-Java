# Program to Calculate the Area and Circumference of a Circle
* Write a Java program that takes the radius of a circle from the user and calculates its area and circumference.

* Area Formula: π * r * r

* Circumference Formula: 2 * π * r

## Homework 
* Write a program in Java that calculates the area of a circular sector with radius r and central angle 𝛼.
* Assume the value of 𝜋 to be 3.14.
* Formula: (𝜋 * (r*r) * 𝛼) / 360
